1. A method that returns the sum of two integers

    Get two numbers from the user
    Add the two numbers together
    Return the sum to the user
    
    START
    GET first number from user
    SET first number as number_1
    GET second number from user
    SET second number as number_2
    Add number_1 + number_2
    SET answer = sum
    PRINT sum
    END
    
    
2. A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together.
    
    Get the array of strings
    Extract each string from the array
    Concatenate the strings together
    Return the new string
    
    START
    GET array of strings
    READ each element in the array
    Extract each element and concatenate
    SET result to concatenated_string
    PRINT concatenated_string
    END
    
3. A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element.

    Get the array of integers
    Extract each integer from the even-numbered places within the array (0, 2, 4...)
    Put these integers into a new array
    Return the new array
    
    START
    GET array of integers
    Extract even numbered places from array and put in new array
    SET these values to new_array
    PRINT new_array
    END
